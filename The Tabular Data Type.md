# The Tabular Data Type
Within a dataset, there are typically columns that can best be described as reference labels.  These columns contain
values which are usually non-numeric-- they wouldn't be used as operands in a mathematical calculation.  
A "reference label" can be a name, color, size, shape, or any word or string that might
be used to further describe and identify a particular dataset row.
